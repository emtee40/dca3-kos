# Overview

KallistiOS is a development library and operating system for the Sega Dreamcast game console, developed independently from Sega entirely by free software developers. Its flexible permissive license allows both homebrew and commercial use with little restrictions besides proper attribution. As a result, it powers most homebrew and commercial indie releases for the platform. Interfaces and drivers are included for a significant portion of the Dreamcast's hardware capabilities and accessories, including modifications created by hobbyists. 

KallistiOS offers a modern, programmer friendly environment for the vintage Dreamcast system. The distribution includes [scripts for building and installing a cross-compiling toolchain](utils/dc-chain/README.md) using the latest GCC, Binutils, and Newlib. This allows for full support for C17 and C++20 standards and libraries, as well as various POSIX APIs. Preliminary support exists for C23, C++23, and Objective-C.

KallistiOS also features a package manager called [**_kos-ports_**](https://github.com/KallistiOS/kos-ports) which gives developers the power to build and include a rich set of add-on libraries for various common audiovisual formats (jpg, png, mp3, ogg, mpeg), compression formats (libbz2, zlib), scripting languages (Lua, Tcl, MicroPython), gaming APIs (OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL), and many more.
